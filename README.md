## Problem Statement

If you are an avid reader, who likes both paper books and e-books you might have experienced the urge of saving wisdom from the books you read in one place by simply scanning and adding the quotes to your personal collection and then sharing the wisdom with your friends and the whole world.

InstaQuo is an iOS app that lets you do that.

## MVP Feature Set

1. A user can login into the app.
2. A user can view and edit their profile that contains:
- personal information (name, location);
- number of quotes added; 
- number of books read.
3. A user can view their feed that contains recently added cards with quotes.
4. A user can add quote to personal collection:
- by taking a picture with smartphone or by choosing a picture from the Photos collection on their mobile device;
- converting the source image into a text by specifying the area of text recognition; 
- editing the quote text; 
- adding title, author, page (for paper book), comments/thoughts, tags;
- sharing the quote on social media.
5. A user can select a card from the feed to edit or delete it.

### Potential Additional Features

1. A user can create a custom design for quote cards: select the background color and text font.
2. Quote cards can be added to a private collection or can be public, so that other users can see it.
3. Users can “like” other users’ quote cards and leave comments.
4. Users can view other users’ profiles and feeds. 
5. Users can save other users’ quote cards to their personal collections. 
6. Grouping the cards by collections/books/authors/genre.
